# solomonsms-disasm
dissasembly of Solomon's Key for Sega Master System

technically it's "Solomon no Kagi - Oujo Rihita no Namida" for the Sega Mark III

you'll need wla-z80 and wlalink in the same directory

disasm is from Emulicious and has not been modified in any way. I'll get around to it later!~
